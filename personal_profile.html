    <p>MBTI results: ISFP-T (Adventurer) <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality" target="_blank">Read more here!</a> <p/>
    <p>Learning style results: Visual learner </p>
    <p>Big Five Personality results: Openness (52%), Conscientiousness (56%), Extraversion (46%), Agreeableness (71%), Neuroticism (60%) </p>
    <p>The test results above are just a way for employers to make a judgement on my personality and behaviour in a workplace and group setting. They may not be fully as accurate as the tests available online are not a scientifically proven way to find out about one’s personality as there are many factors behind the personality and behaviour we developed since birth such as the environment, but it is the most convenient way to make an estimated judgement without much cost and time required. Personally, I think that the results of these tests should not be relied on until the time of the job interview as it takes a certain amount of time to get to know people rather than basing it off an online test.  </p>
    <p>Based on the results stated above, both personality tests have shown that I am an introverted person. Besides that, it has stated that a person with the “adventurer” personality type is more known about their adaptability and spontaneity as they are often most likely to use the “unconventional” ways that can be risky sometimes to solve a problem. However, adventurers often show themselves to be passionate learners and problem solvers that will want to feel appreciated after completing a certain task. Despite being an introvert, I like to give out advice to people and I do enjoy being in a group setting to put myself out there to gain some networking skills and connections. I also like to think I am easy-going based on the high level on agreeableness on the Big Five Personality test result which makes team projects and working in a group much easier compared to a teammate that has a lower level of agreeableness. However, I am confident that I will be comfortable enough to voice out my opinions rather than keeping them silent as the most important factor of being in a team is communication to make the process of completing a certain task or process as smooth as possible.  </<p>
    <p>If I were to form a team, I would make sure that my team members would not be afraid to speak up their opinions and ideas hence having a higher level in extraversion in the Big Five Personality test as they will be an outgoing and outspoken person. I would also appreciate if my team member has a higher level of conscientiousness as individuals with higher level of conscientiousness tend to have better self-discipline and are more likely to have the determination to pursue and complete their goals compared to individuals who are lower in the personality.  </p>
