    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>“ZS Security” is a computer auto-lock application that uses facial recognition with the help of the laptop’s webcam to detect users faces and it will instantly lock the computer when the user’s face is not in sight and can’t be detected. Users are able to leave their laptops unattended without having to worry about cyber criminals to get hold of confidential information or install malwares into their devices to download information conveniently. As we all know, there are many disadvantages and risks of leaving your devices unattended in the public where intruders can read confidential information whether it is personal or business-related. </p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>There was a case I read online a couple years back that a detective has left their device completely unattended at an airport where the laptop was open and is easily accessible to the crowded space with a crime scene photo being shown on the screen. We should be responsible for our belongings especially devices that contain personal or sensitive information to avoid being hacked by cyber criminals online. </p>
    <p>Security is not just about having a strong password that may be hard to crack, but it is also a whole larger picture with the internet of things that is coming into play and all new technology such as face recognition. A well-known example to that statement is the Apple ID with the help of the advanced facial recognition and the artificial intelligence technology where certain iPhone users can unlock their phones with a mask on due to the global pandemic of Covid-19. </p>
    <p>This gave me the inspiration of making an application for laptops conveniently with the help of the built-in webcams that come with the laptop to create a way to make leaving the device unattended much safer compared to before. </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The ZS Security app will be completely free to download for all users with laptops that have 64 bits processor however a 32 bits processor can also be used but it may not be as accurate compared to the 64 bits processor device. A Microsoft Windows 7 and above or a macOS 10 and above would give you the optimal performance and accuracy. Users would also have to note that their webcams are accessible using DirectShow or GStreamer. </p>
    <p>Once downloaded, users would have set up just by creating a facial recognition just like how they would do on some newer mobile phones. ZS Security app will recognise up to 5 faces which is very convenient for a family who is sharing one device and they will not have to worry if the primary user steps away from the laptop. The application will be opened automatically after users have logged into their computers where they are able to choose whether they would prefer the application to be minimised when opened or to display the window onto their screen right when they log onto their device. This function is inspired by the music streaming service, Spotify, where their users can download the application onto their laptops and they would have the option to automatically open the Spotify application after logging into the computer. </p>
    <p>This means that if the device is logged into, the application and software would start running. When users walk away from their device and their face are no longer in sight by the webcam, the software would then process the laptop to turn off or log off immediately to avoid intruders to get a look of their computer display as it may be showing sensitive information. Users are allowed to turn off the automatic running function on the application by going into the settings and click the “manual” or “based on location” button where they can save their home and office address if they do not want the application to run if they are home or in their workplace. This will then allow the application to have a distance range where it will automatically turn on when the user is not within the range they have their addresses saved. </p>
    <p>The software would also track the user’s IP address as an additional backup plan so when they are at a public location with an unsecure IP address, the application would be able to detect it and automatically start running in case if the user has forgotten to turn it on. Since it is an application, majority of the people would click the close button on the top right corner of their screens to close any tabs before shutting down their laptops, however, the ZS Security app will have a warning pop up on the screen if any user tries to close the window stating that the application will not needed to be closed before shutting down and it would not cause any harm to the computer so users can just shut down their computers like they usually would. </p>
    <h3>Tools, technologies and skills required</h3>
    <p>To develop the ZS Security app, I would be using Java on the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as it this IDE allows developers to create applications quicker and in a much simpler way compared to other IDEs. As a beginner to coding myself, I will very much likely prefer a simple platform to create an application that is straightforward, and it does not have to require many tools as it can get complicated. </p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>If this project came out to be successful, users should not have to worry about leaving their devices unattended and getting intruded by cyber criminals with the help of the facial recognition technology that is so advanced today. I hope I have helped people to make their laptops more secure from this application I have ideated especially to people who are always on the go working in public areas and also people who has a job scope that contain highly sensitive information. </p>
