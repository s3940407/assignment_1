    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>With technology advancing so quickly today, I started developing an interest in IT at a relatively young age as I am always into the latest technology and the latest tech equipment any company releases. I tend to compare the new features of newly released phones or gadgets with the older versions and notice how much changes there is with an increase in the price of those goods as well. My family inspired me to get into the IT field as my siblings are both currently working and studying in IT industries. My parents owns a small company in the transportation industry where multiple software is used on a daily basis in order to get their jobs done and I used to help them during summer breaks or short breaks I had before leaving for Australia to pursue my studies. By using the software, it has made us work more efficiently as compared to getting it done manually which could require extra amount of time to get the job done. </p>
    <p>One of the main reasons I chose to pursue my studies in IT is because I am highly passionate about helping other businesses and business owners by making their lives much easier and efficient. I also want to help business owners to keep their data safe and create new ways to protect data from getting hacked by intruders online as it is a common problem for many people especially small businesses who do not own as much capital compared to larger and major companies with huge amounts of capital to provide the best security possible to protect their data from being stolen or leaked out.  </p>
    <p>I chose to enrol my course in RMIT because it has been one of my dream universities ever since I found my passion in IT as I have heard plenty of great reviews on the university prior to applying into this university. According to RMIT’s website, it states that “the university is currently ranked first after moving up to four places in Australia, was ranked 18th in the Asia Pacific and 43rd globally for graduate employment rate” (RMIT 2021). This gives me the assurance I needed that I wouldn’t have to worry about being unemployed for a large amount of time after graduating from my bachelor’s course. </p>
    <p>Throughout this course, I am hoping to learn a variety of skills that includes practical skills and soft skills. Based on this assignment, I will be able to develop practical skills by learning how to create a simple website with the help of GitHub Pages. I will also be able to gain multiple soft skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking by being exposed to some problems that are faced in this world of technology. </p>
