    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

    <p>With technology advancing so quickly today, I started developing an interest in IT at a relatively young age as I am always into the latest technology and the latest tech equipment any company releases. I tend to compare the new features of newly released phones or gadgets with the older versions and notice how much change can there be with an increase in the price of those goods as well. My family inspire me to go into the IT field as my siblings are both currently working and studying in IT industries. My parents own a small company in the transportation industry where they must use multiple software on a daily basis in order to get their jobs done and I used to help them when I was back home during summer breaks or the short break I had before leaving for Australia to pursue my studies. By using the software, it made us much more efficient compared to doing it by ourselves manually which could double or triple the amount of time to get the job done.</p>
    <p>One of the main reasons I came into IT was because I am highly passionate about helping other businesses and business owners by making their lives much easier and efficient. I also want to help business owners to keep their data safe and create new ways to protect data from getting hacked by intruders online as it is a common problem for many people especially small businesses who do not own as much capital compared to larger and major companies with huge amounts of capital to provide the best security possible to protect their data from being stolen or leaked out. </p>
    <p>I chose to enrol my course in RMIT because it has been one of my dream universities ever since I found my passion of technology and IT as I have heard plenty of great reviews on the university prior to applying into universities. RMIT is also one of the well-known universities that specialises in courses relating to technology with a high fresh graduate employability rate of 62.1% due to its network and connections with other companies in Australia. I personally love how convenient the location of the city campus is to the State Library of Victoria and public transportations which make commuting much easier for students to travel from home.</p>
    <p>Throughout this course, I am hoping to learn a variety of skills that includes practical skills and soft skills. Based on this assignment, I will be able to develop a practical skill by learning how to create a simple website with the help of GitHub Pages. I will also be able to gain multiple soft skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking by being exposed to some problems that are faced in this world of technology.</p>

    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>

    <p>The global company named ‘Accenture’ has a spot for the cyber incident response specialist position. Based on my understanding of the job description, this position is the first person that the representative of other departments (such as: human resources), go to when there is a cyber security related problem. This position also requires investigating on cases such as code of business ethics violation, malware and cyber-attacks such as hacking and security branches. The reason why this job advertisement appeals to me is because of its job description as I am highly interested in cybersecurity and problem solving. Being able to work in one of the most prestigious firms in the industry as a representative of the Asian and women community will be a huge honour and I will be able to inspire other people in the community that is interested into being in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) filed. This position also requires employing others of technical, investigative and analytical skills in which are needed to form my own team in the department. I personally enjoy helping others who I think are worth helping such as employing individuals who are highly skilled and what I think are a great fit into the jobs required. I also have always dreamt of being a part of Accenture’s security team as they are one of the leading companies that has the capabilities in digital, cloud and security.</p>
    <p>In this advertisement, the candidate is required to have a various amount of experience and qualifications. One of those qualifications is to hold a 4-year degree in computer science or any related field. I am planning to continue two more years of studies after obtaining my bachelor’s degree for a Master of Cyber Security that is offered in RMIT. This course requires me to participate in team-based projects and to engage in various activities which would help me to further increase my communication skills with my team members. </p>
    <p>The company also require the candidate to be a holder of a couple computer forensics and information security certificates listed on the advertisement (and the image attached), one of which is the “Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (CHFI)” certificate that is certified by the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants (EC-Council). A certified CHFI professional’s role is to detect a hacker attack whilst using multiple methods to extract evidence, reporting the crime and putting the system in place to prevent any future attacks. The CHFI program is targeted to IT professionals who are heavily involved with information system security, computer forensics and incident response. Another certificate that is required for the job position is the “Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)” that is granted by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2). Unlike the CHFI course, there are a few requirements to be met prior to be able to sit for the course and to obtain the certificate such as having a minimum of 5 years’ experience in full-time security field of at least two of the ISC2’s domains. Some of the domains include “security and risk management”, “communication and network security” and “security assessment and testing”. There is also a 3-hour multiple choice CISSP exam that must be taken and candidates must obtain at least 700 points out of the 1000 points available passing all eight domains of the test in order to be able to achieve the certificate. </p>
    <p>My skills are currently really limited as I am still a freshman in university and I did not have any background and knowledge on coding prior to my course. However, I believe that my skills and knowledge on network and computing will be wider after completing my bachelor’s course. After completing my master’s degree (as mentioned above), I will be seeking a job in the industry that is related to my degrees to gain experience and learn more about the real world and day-to-day cases in a company. After a few years of experience, I will be planning to move onto a better position as an information security discipline which is a chief component of cyber security that ensures protection over sensitive information whilst also being able to access it easily when needed. While having a full-time job, I will also be focusing on the CISSP and CHFI training in the span of a few years to obtain the certificates needed in order to be a perfect candidate for the job position. </p>
