    <h3>Brief description</h3>
    <p>The global company named ‘Accenture’ has a job opening for Cyber Incident Response Specialist position. Based on my understanding of the job description, this position is where one is a representative for other departments (such as: Human Resources), and solve security issues when there is a cyber security related problem. This position also requires investigating on cases such as Code of Business Ethics Violation, Malware and Cyber-Attacks such as hacking and security breaches.   </p>
    <h3>Why does it appeal to me?</h3>
    <p>The reason this job advertisement appeals to me is because of its job description as I am highly interested in cyber security and problem solving. Being able to work in one of the most prestigious firms in the industry as a representative of the Asian and women community will be a huge honour and I will be able to inspire others in the community that is interested being in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) field. This position also requires to employ technical, investigative and analytical skills in which are needed to solve various types of issues and problems. I have always dreamt of being a part of Accenture’s security team as they are one of the leading companies that has the capabilities in digital, cloud and security. </p>
    <h3>Qualifications</h3>
    <p>In this advertisement, the candidate is required to have a various amount of experience and qualifications. One of those qualifications is to hold a 4-year degree in computer science or any related field. I have plans to pursue in Master of Cyber Security after obtaining my bachelor’s in RMIT. This course requires me to participate in team-based projects and to engage in various activities which would help me to improve my communication skills with my team members.  </p>
    <h3>About CHFI</h3>
    <p>The company also requires the candidate to be a holder of a couple of Computer Forensics and Information Security certificates listed on the advertisement, one of which is the “Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (CHFI)” certificate that is certified by the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants (EC-Council). A certified CHFI professional’s role is to detect an attack whilst using multiple methods to extract evidence, reporting the crime and putting the system in place to prevent any future attacks. The CHFI program is targeted to IT professionals who are heavily involved with Information System Security, Computer Forensics and Incident Response.  </p>
    <h3>About CISSP</h3>
    <p>Another certificate that is required for the job position is the “Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)” that is granted by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2). Unlike the CHFI course, there are a few requirements to be met prior to be able to sit for the course and to obtain the certificate such as having a minimum of 5 years’ experience in full-time security field of at least two of the ISC2’s topics that are provided. Some of the domains include “Security and Risk Management”, “Communication and Network Security” and “Security Assessment and Testing”. There is also a 3-hour multiple choice CISSP exam that is required to be taken and candidates must obtain at least 700 points out of the 1000 points available passing all eight domains of the test in order to obtain the certificate. </p>
    <h3>Skills I currently have and future plans</h3>
    <p>My skills are currently really limited as I am still a freshman in university and I do not have any background and knowledge on coding prior to my course. However, I believe that my skills and knowledge on Network and Computing will be wider after completing my bachelor’s course. After completing my master’s degree (as mentioned above), I will be seeking for a job in an industry that is related to my degrees to gain experience and learn more about the real world and day-to-day cases in a company. After a few years of experience, I am planning to move onto a better position as an Information Security Discipline which is a Chief Component of Cyber Security that ensures protection over sensitive information whilst also being able to access it easily when needed. While having a full-time job, I will also be focusing on the CISSP and CHFI training in the span of a few years to obtain the certificates needed in order to be a perfect candidate for the job position.  </p>
